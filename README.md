## 💡 What I Learned

This wasn’t just about following along—it was about **leveling up** as a developer:

- **End-to-end full-stack workflow**: From backend API creation with .NET to building dynamic front ends with Angular.
- **Client-side routing and guards**: Protecting routes and managing client state effectively.
- **Forms in Angular**: Deep dive into Template-driven & Reactive forms, with validation techniques.
- **WebSocket basics with SignalR**: Real-time communication made simple.
- **Using Automapper**: Streamlining object-to-object mapping on the backend.
- **UI design with Bootstrap**: Fast and clean component styling.
- **Version control discipline**: Managed my own GitHub repo throughout the course, tracking changes and progress independently.
